# **6. Kubernetes Core Objects**
Kubernetes is built around a set of core objects that serve as the fundamental building blocks for defining, deploying, and managing applications. These objects encapsulate various aspects of application management, such as workload deployment, networking, configuration, and isolation.

Understanding these objects is crucial to leveraging the full power of Kubernetes. In this section, we’ll explore these core objects, how they work, and their significance in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## **6.1 Pods**
### **What Are Pods?**
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. A pod typically contains one or more tightly coupled containers that share:
* **Networking**: All containers in a pod share the same IP address and port space.
* **Storage**: Pods can share mounted volumes for persistent storage.
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-name-xyz              1/1     Running   0          5m
pod-name-abc              1/1     Running   0          10m
```

### **Why Pods Matter?**
Pods are at the heart of Kubernetes. They:
* Enable co-located processes to run together and share resources.
* Serve as the abstraction layer between containers and Kubernetes.

### **Key Features of Pods**
* **Ephemeral Nature**: Pods are designed to be short-lived. If a pod fails, Kubernetes replaces it with a new one.
* **Resource Sharing**: Containers in a pod can communicate over localhost and share environment variables and file systems.
* **Scaling**: While individual pods are ephemeral, they are typically managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments to ensure replication and availability.

### **Practical Example**
For example, a pod might run:
* A web server container and a sidecar container for logging.
* A primary application container with a helper container to pull configuration files.

## **6.2 Services**
### **What Are Services?**
A Service in Kubernetes is a stable abstraction that exposes an application running in a set of pods as a network service. Since pods are ephemeral, services provide a consistent way to access pods, even as they are replaced or rescheduled.
```
$ kubectl get services
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service-name    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        80/TCP         10m
another-service NodePort    10.96.0.2        <none>        8080:30000/TCP 15m
```

### **Why Services Matter?**
Services decouple application components by providing:
* **Stable Endpoints**: Pods may change, but the service remains constant.
* **Load Balancing**: Services distribute network traffic among pods.
* **Discovery**: Kubernetes allows other applications to discover services automatically.

### **Types of Services**
* **ClusterIP**: Default type that exposes the service internally to the cluster.
* **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each node.
* **LoadBalancer**: Integrates with cloud providers to expose the service via an external load balancer.
* **ExternalName**: Maps a service to an external hostname.

### **Practical Example**
A frontend application might use a service to communicate with a backend API, ensuring that requests are properly routed to available pods.

## **6.3 Deployments**

### **What Are Deployments?**
A Deployment is a Kubernetes object used to manage stateless applications. It provides declarative updates for pods and replica sets, ensuring that the desired number of pods are running and up-to-date.
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment-name    3/3     3            3           10m
another-deployment 2/2     2            2           15m
```

### **Why Deployments Matter?**
Deployments automate critical tasks such as:
* Scaling applications by increasing or decreasing pod replicas.
* Rolling updates to ensure zero downtime when deploying new versions.
* Rollbacks to revert to a previous state in case of failures.

### **Key Features of Deployments**
* **Replica Sets**: Deployments manage replica sets to ensure a specified number of pod replicas.
* **Update Strategies**: Support rolling updates and on-demand rollbacks.
* **Declarative Management**: Define the desired state, and Kubernetes ensures that the current state matches it.

### **Practical Example**
Imagine deploying a web server:
* A deployment ensures that five replicas of the server are always running.
* When you update the server's image, Kubernetes gradually replaces old pods with new ones to prevent downtime.

## **6.4 ConfigMaps and Secrets**
### **What Are ConfigMaps and Secrets?**
* **ConfigMaps**: Store configuration data as key-value pairs that pods can use. For example, environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files.
* **Secrets**: Similar to ConfigMaps but specifically designed to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, or SSH keys, in an encrypted format.

### **Why ConfigMaps and Secrets Matter?**
Separating configuration and sensitive data from the application allows:
* **Flexibility**: Modify configurations without rebuilding images.
* **Security**: Keep sensitive information out of application code and images.
* **Portability**: Easily deploy the same application with different configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

### **Key Features**
* **Decoupling**: Applications don’t need to hard-code settings or secrets.
* **Dynamic Updates**: Pods can reload configurations dynamically.
* **Namespace Isolation**: ConfigMaps and Secrets are namespace-scoped for security.

### **Practical Example**
A ConfigMap might store application settings, while a Secret could securely hold the database credentials needed by the application.

## **6.5 Namespaces**

### **What Are Namespaces?**
A Namespace is a Kubernetes abstraction used to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams. It provides a scope for names, ensuring that resources like pods, services, and ConfigMaps with the same name can coexist in separate namespaces.
```
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   9m10s
kube-node-lease   Active   9m10s
kube-public       Active   9m10s
kube-system       Active   9m10s

```

### **Why Namespaces Matter?**
Namespaces are critical for:
* **Resource Isolation**: Separate environments like development, staging, and production.
* **Multi-Tenancy**: Allow multiple teams to use the same cluster without conflicts.
* **Resource Quotas**: Enforce limits on resource usage within a namespace.

### **Key Features**
* **Default Namespace**: If no namespace is specified, Kubernetes places resources in the default namespace.
* **Kube-System Namespace**: Reserved for Kubernetes system components.
* **Custom Namespaces**: Users can create namespaces tailored to their needs.

### **Practical Example**
A large organization might use namespaces to:
* Separate environments (dev, test, prod).
* Provide isolated environments for different teams or applications.
