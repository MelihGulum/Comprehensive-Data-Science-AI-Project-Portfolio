# **3.1. Minikube Installation**
Minikube is one of the most popular tools for setting up a local Kubernetes environment. It provides a quick and straightforward way to deploy and test Kubernetes clusters on your local machine, making it ideal for development, testing, and learning.

## **3.1.1 Prerequisites**
Before installing Minikube, ensure the following system requirements are met to avoid configuration issues during the installation:

* **Hardware Requirements**:
  - A system with at least **2 CPUs, 2GB of RAM, and 20GB of disk space**. These are the minimum requirements for running a stable cluster, but more resources might be needed for demanding workloads.
* **Software Requirements**:
  - A supported **hypervisor** like VirtualBox, Docker, or Hyper-V must be installed to host the virtualized Minikube cluster.
  - kubectl, the Kubernetes CLI tool, should also be installed. It allows you to manage the Kubernetes cluster effectively, interact with its objects, and troubleshoot issues.
 
## **3.1.2 Installation Steps**
### **Step 1: Download and Install Minikube**
Installation varies by platform, but Minikube makes it simple with binaries and package managers:
* **Linux Installation**:
Use the following commands to download and install the latest Minikube binary:
```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```
The binary is lightweight, making it easy to download and install on most Linux distributions.
* **macOS Installation**:
Use the Homebrew package manager for a seamless experience:
```
brew install minikube
```
Homebrew manages updates and dependencies, ensuring Minikube integrates smoothly with macOS tools.
* **Windows Installation**:
Download the installer executable [from the official Minikube releases page](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download). This process provides a graphical installation wizard for users less comfortable with command-line operations.

### **Step 2: Verify Installation**
Once Minikube is installed and started, it’s essential to verify that everything is working as expected. Follow these steps:

1. **Check Minikube Version**:
Confirm that Minikube is installed correctly by checking its version:
```
$ minikube version
minikube version: v1.30.1
commit: 9c1c1bd4b6351b1b687a04c715b04f549f9e5473
```
2. **Check kubectl Version**:
Verify that the kubectl command-line tool is installed and compatible with the Minikube version:
```
$ kubectl version
Client Version: v1.30.2
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.31.0
```
3. **Check Node Status**:
Once Minikube is started, confirm that the Kubernetes cluster node is ready:

```
$ minikube kubectl -- get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   10s   v1.31.0
```

### **Step 3: Start Minikube**
Once Minikube is installed, you can start your local cluster with a simple command:
```
$ minikube start
* minikube v1.34.0 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19045.5247 Build 19045.5247
* Automatically selected the docker driver
* Using Docker Desktop driver with root privileges
* Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
* Pulling base image v0.0.45 ...
* Creating docker container (CPUs=2, Memory=2200MB) ...
! Failing to connect to https://registry.k8s.io/ from inside the minikube container
* To pull new external images, you may need to configure a proxy: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/networking/proxy/
* Preparing Kubernetes v1.31.0 on Docker 27.2.0 ...
  - Generating certificates and keys ...
  - Booting up control plane ...
  - Configuring RBAC rules ...
* Configuring bridge CNI (Container Networking Interface) ...
* Verifying Kubernetes components...
  - Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
* Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
* Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default

$
```
It can take several minutes before your cluster is ready to use. Progress will be shown in your terminal.

Minikube automatically selects the best driver based on your system configuration. However, you can specify a particular driver like Docker or VirtualBox:

```
$ minikube start --driver=docker
```
Additional options let you customize resources:
```
$ minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --disk-size=20g
```
This command starts Minikube with 4 CPUs, 8GB of memory, and 20GB of disk space allocated to the virtualized environment.

## **3.1.3 Accessing Kubernetes Features with Minikube**
Minikube provides tools and commands to explore Kubernetes features:

* **Kubernetes Dashboard**:
Minikube includes a built-in web-based Kubernetes dashboard for managing and monitoring resources. This opens a user-friendly interface where you can view pods, services, and deployments in real time.
Launch it with:
```
$ minikube dashboard
```

* **List and Enable Add-ons**:
Minikube supports various add-ons to extend Kubernetes functionality, such as metrics-server for resource monitoring and ingress for routing traffic:

```
$ minikube addons list
```
```
$ minikube addons enable metrics-server

# The output is similar to:
# The 'metrics-server' addon is enabled
```
* **Access Services**:
Expose services running within Minikube to your local machine using the minikube service command:
```
$ minikube service <service-name>
```
