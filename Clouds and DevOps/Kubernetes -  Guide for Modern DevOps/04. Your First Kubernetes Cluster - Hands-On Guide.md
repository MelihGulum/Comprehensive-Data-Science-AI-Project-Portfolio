# **4. Your First Kubernetes Cluster Hands-On Guide**
Now that you've learned the fundamentals of Kubernetes, it's time to dive into the practical aspects. This section will guide you through setting up your first Kubernetes cluster, running applications, scaling them, updating them, and cleaning up your environment once you're done.

## **Setting Up Your First Cluster**
Before you can deploy applications on Kubernetes, you need to set up your cluster. In this guide, we’ll use Minikube to create a local cluster. Minikube provides a simplified way to run Kubernetes clusters on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. **Start Minikube**
Use the minikube start command to initialize your local Kubernetes cluster. Minikube will download necessary dependencies and spin up a virtual machine to run the cluster. This process might take a few minutes, depending on your system’s resources.
```
$ minikube start
```

2. **Verify Cluster Status**
Once the cluster has started, you can check its status using:
```
$ minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```
3. **Access Cluster Information**
After the cluster is running, interact with it using kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool. Make sure that your local environment is connected to your Minikube cluster. This will show you the URL of the Kubernetes control plane and the DNS service, confirming that your cluster is operational.
```
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://<master-ip>:<port>
KubeDNS is running at https://<master-ip>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

## **Running Your First Application**
Now that your cluster is running, you can deploy your first application. Kubernetes uses Pods to deploy and manage containers, and you can expose these applications as services.

1. **Create a deployment**:
To run a simple application, let’s deploy the nginx web server, which is a common application used for demonstrations. Run the following command to create a deployment:
```
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
deployment.apps/nginx created
```
This command deploys the nginx image on your cluster, creating a new deployment named nginx.

2. **Check the deployment status**:
Use the following command to check if your pods are running:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-676b6c5bbc-6dtbm   1/1     Running   0          6m5s
```
You should see your nginx pod listed with the status "Running."

3. **Expose the application**:
Now, expose your deployment to access it externally. This will create a Service that routes traffic to the nginx pod.
```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
service/nginx exposed
```
You can now access the application by visiting the URL provided by Minikube:
```
$ minikube service nginx --url
http://127.0.0.1:XXXXX
```
Where XXXXX is a randomly assigned port by Minikube that forwards to the nginx service inside the cluster. This URL allows you to access the nginx service from your local machine.

## **Scaling Applications with kubectl scale**
Kubernetes allows you to scale your applications easily to handle increased traffic or workloads. You can scale deployments to run more or fewer replicas of your application.

1. **Scale the nginx deployment**:
To scale the nginx deployment to 3 replicas, run the following command:
```
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
deployment.apps/nginx scaled
```
2. **Verify the scaling**:
Use the following command to check the number of running replicas:
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx   3/3     3            3           5m2s
```
You should see the nginx deployment with 3 replicas running.

## **Updating Applications with kubectl apply**
Kubernetes makes updating applications straightforward. When you need to update an application, you can modify the deployment configuration and apply the changes without downtime.

1. **Update the deployment image**:
Let's say you want to update your nginx deployment to use a newer version of the nginx image. Run the following command to update the deployment:
```
$ kubectl set image deployment/nginx nginx=nginx:latest
```
This will trigger a rolling update to apply the new image version to the running pods.

2. **Check the deployment status**:
You can watch the update progress with the following command:
```
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx
```
This command will confirm that the update was successful and that the new version is running.

## **Deleting Applications and Cleaning Up**
After testing and deploying applications, it’s important to clean up unused resources to prevent unnecessary costs and clutter in your cluster.

1. **Delete the deployment**:
To delete the nginx deployment and all related resources (pods and services), run:
```
$ kubectl delete deployment nginx
deployment.apps "nginx" deleted
```
2. **Delete the service**:
If you created a service to expose the nginx deployment, you should delete it as well:
```
$ kubectl delete service nginx
service "nginx" deleted
```
3. **Clean up all resources**:
You can also clean up all resources in your cluster by running:
```
$ kubectl delete all --all
```
This will delete all deployments, services, pods, etc., within the default namespace.

# **Conclusion**
In this hands-on guide, you’ve learned how to set up a Kubernetes cluster, deploy an application, scale it, update it, and clean up resources. These are fundamental tasks that will help you get comfortable with Kubernetes and start building more complex applications. Kubernetes' flexibility and power allow you to efficiently manage applications, whether you’re running them locally on Minikube or in a production environment.
