# **Section 8: Debugging in Docker**
Efficient debugging is key to maintaining reliable systems. Docker offers powerful tools to troubleshoot issues, from inspecting logs and container states to debugging networks. This guide equips you to quickly diagnose and resolve challenges, ensuring smooth development and production workflows

1. **Inspect Logs:** The docker logs command fetches container logs, which are often the first step in debugging.

* View Logs of a Running Container:
```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

```bash
# Add the -f flag to follow live logs:

docker logs -f <container_name>
```

2. **Interactive Debugging with docker exec:** The docker exec command allows you to run commands inside a running container.

* Access the Container: This opens an interactive shell inside the container.
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> bash
```

* Run a Debugging Command:
```bash
docker exec <container_name> cat /app/logs.txt
```

3. **Inspect the Container State:** The docker inspect command provides detailed JSON output of a containerâ€™s configuration and state.
```bash
docker inspect <container_name>
```

4. **Networking Debugging:** Use docker network commands to debug network-related issues:

* List networks:
```bash
docker network ls
```

* Inspect a specific network:
```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
