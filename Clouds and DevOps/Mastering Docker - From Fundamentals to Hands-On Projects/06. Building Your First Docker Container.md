# **Section 6: Building Your First Docker Container**
In this section, we will guide you through creating your first Docker container by building a simple Python Flask application. This hands-on example demonstrates how to containerize an application from scratch, write a Dockerfile, and run the containerized app.

## **Step 1: Create a Simple Python Flask Application**
Weâ€™ll start with a minimal Flask application that serves a "Hello, Docker!" message.

1. **Create a New Directory for Your Project**
```bash
mkdir flask-docker-app
cd flask-docker-app
```
2. **Write the Application Code:** Create a file named app.py and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Docker!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
3. **Install Flask (Optional for Local Testing):** If you want to test this locally, ensure Flask is installed.
```bash
pip install flask
```

4. **Run Locally (Optional):** Test the application by running: 
```python
python app.py
# Access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
```

## **Step 2: Write a Dockerfile**
A Dockerfile is a script of instructions that Docker uses to build a container image. Create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory and add the following:

```dockerfile
# Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Install the necessary dependencies
RUN pip install flask

# Step 5: Make port 5000 available to the outside world
EXPOSE 5000

# Step 6: Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Explanation of Each Step:**
* **FROM**: Specifies the base image. Here, we use a lightweight Python 3.9 image.
* **WORKDIR**: Sets /app as the working directory inside the container.
* **COPY**: Copies the project files from your local machine to the container.
* **RUN**: Installs Flask inside the container using pip.
* **EXPOSE**: Opens port 5000 for the container.
* **CMD**: Defines the default command to run the app when the container starts.

## **Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container**
1. **Build the Docker Image:** Run the following command to build the image.
```bash
docker build -t flask-docker-app .
```
* -t flask-docker-app: Tags the image with the name flask-docker-app.
* . Specifies the current directory as the build context.
2. **Run the Docker Container:** Start a container from the image:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-docker-app
```
* -p 5000:5000: Maps port 5000 on your host to port 5000 in the container.
3. **Access the Application:** Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000. You should see "Hello, Docker!".


## **Step 4: Verify the Container**
1. **List Running Containers:** Check if your container is running.
```bash
docker ps
```
2. **Stop the Container:** Stop the container using its name or ID.
```bash
docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
```
3. **Remove the Container:** Remove the stopped container.
```bash
docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
```

## **Step 5: Tips for Further Exploration**
1. **Add Dependencies:** If your application grows, you can use a requirements.txt file for managing dependencies. Update the Dockerfile to install them:

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Multi-Stage Builds:** Optimize the Docker image size using multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the runtime environment.
3. **Push to Docker Hub:** Publish your image for reuse:
```bash
docker tag flask-docker-app your-dockerhub-username/flask-docker-app
docker push your-dockerhub-username/flask-docker-app
```

# **Conclusion**
Congratulations! You have successfully built and run your first Docker container. This exercise highlights the power of Docker for isolating applications and their dependencies. From here, you can explore more advanced topics like multi-service applications, orchestration with Docker Compose, or deploying containers to the cloud.
