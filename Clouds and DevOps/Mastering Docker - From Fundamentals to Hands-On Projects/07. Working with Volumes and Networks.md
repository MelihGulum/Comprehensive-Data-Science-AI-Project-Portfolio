# **Section 7: Working with Volumes and Networks**
In this section, we delve into two essential aspects of Docker: Volumes (for data persistence) and Networking (for container communication). These features are critical for building scalable, robust applications that manage data effectively and ensure seamless container communication.

## **Data Persistence with Volumes**
Containers are ephemeral by nature, meaning data inside a container is lost when it stops or is removed. To address this, Docker provides volumes—a way to persist data outside the container.

#### **What Are Volumes?**
Volumes are storage areas managed by Docker, independent of the container’s lifecycle. They allow containers to access and share data with the host or other containers.


1. **Create and Use a Volume in a Container:** Run a container with a volume attached:
```bash
docker run -d -v my-volume:/data --name volume-demo ubuntu

# -v my-volume:/data: Maps a Docker-managed volume (my-volume) to the /data directory in the container.
# ubuntu: The base image used.
 ``` 
2. **Inspect the Volume:** Check details of the volume:
```bash
docker volume inspect my-volume
```

3. **View the Volume Data:** Enter the container and view the data stored in the /data directory:
```bash
docker exec -it volume-demo bash
ls /data
```

4. **Bind Mounts vs. Volumes:**
     - Volumes are managed by Docker and stored in Docker's area on the host.
     - Bind Mounts directly map a specific host directory to a container. Use this for development when you need the container to access live code changes.

#### **Example: Persisting Data in a Flask App**
Update your Flask application to store logs:

1. **Modify app.py to log messages:**
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    with open('/data/logs.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write("Visited Home Page\n")
    return "Hello, Docker with Volumes!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

2. **Run the container with a volume:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v my-flask-logs:/data flask-docker-app
```

3. **Check the log file in the volume**:
```bash
docker volume inspect my-flask-logs
```

## **Networking in Docker**
Docker’s networking capabilities allow containers to communicate with each other, the host, and external services.

#### **Types of Docker Networks**
* **Bridge (Default)**: Isolated networks for containers. Suitable for most use cases.
* **Host:** Shares the host’s networking stack (no isolation).
* **None:** No networking (completely isolated).
* **Overlay:** Multi-host communication for swarm services.

#### **Port Mapping**
Port mapping connects a container’s internal ports to ports on the host machine.

Example: This maps port 5000 in the container to port 8080 on the host.
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:5000 flask-docker-app
```

#### **Linking Containers**
Linking containers allows them to communicate within the same network.

1. **Create a Custom Network**
```bash
docker network create my-network
```

2. **Run Containers in the Network:** Start a Flask app and a database in the same network:
```bash
docker run -d --name flask-app --network my-network flask-docker-app
docker run -d --name redis-db --network my-network redis
```

3. **Access the Redis Container:** In the Flask app container, you can now access the Redis database by its container name (redis-db).

#### **Demonstration: Flask with Redis**
Modify the Flask app to use Redis for storing page views.

1. **Update app.py:**
```python
from flask import Flask
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis-db', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    visits = redis_client.incr('visits')
    return f"Hello, Docker! You are visitor #{visits}."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

2. **Build the updated image:**
```bash
docker build -t flask-redis-app .
```

3. **Run the containers:**
```bash
docker network create flask-redis-network
docker run -d --name redis-db --network flask-redis-network redis
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-app --network flask-redis-network flask-redis-app
```
4. **Access the app** at http://localhost:5000 and see the visitor count increase.

# **Conclusion**
By combining volumes and networks, Docker enables seamless data persistence and container-to-container communication, even in complex multi-service environments. These concepts are fundamental when developing, deploying, and scaling applications with Docker.
