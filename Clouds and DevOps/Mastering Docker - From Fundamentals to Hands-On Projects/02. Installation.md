# **Section 2: Setting Up Docker**
Before diving into Docker’s powerful features, let’s ensure your system is ready to run Docker. This section will guide you through installing Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS or Docker Engine on Linux and verify the installation. 

You can also refer to the [official documentation for installing Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

## **Installation Steps**
1. **Installing Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)**: Docker Desktop is an all-in-one solution that simplifies the process of installing and managing Docker on your system.

    * **Windows**
      1. Download Docker Desktop for Windows from the official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
      2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
      3. Ensure your system meets the requirements:
      4. Windows 10/11 (64-bit): Pro, Enterprise, or Education. For Windows Home, WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is required.
      5. Enable virtualization in BIOS.
      6. During installation, Docker Desktop will prompt you to enable WSL 2 and install its update if necessary.
    * **MacOS**
      1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).
      2. Run the .dmg file and drag the Docker icon to your Applications folder.
      3. Docker Desktop requires macOS 11 or newer.

3. **Installing Docker Engine (Linux)**: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) provides a lightweight, CLI-based Docker setup. The steps below are for Ubuntu, but Docker supports various distributions.

  * Update Your System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

  * Install Required Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install \
ca-certificates \
curl \
gnupg \
lsb-release
```
   * Add Docker’s GPG Key and Repository
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
  * Install Docker Engine
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
  * Start and Enable Docker
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

## **Verify Installation**
After installing Docker, verify that it is working correctly.

**Step 1: Check Docker Version**
* Run the following command to confirm Docker is installed:
```bash
C:\Users\mlh>docker version

Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           23.0.3
 API version:       1.42
 Go version:        go1.19.7
 Git commit:        3e7cbfd
 Built:             Tue Apr  4 22:05:41 2023
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
 Context:           default

Server: Docker Desktop 4.19.0 (12345)
 Engine:
  Version:          23.0.3
  API version:      1.42 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.19.7
  Git commit:       59118bf
  Built:            Tue Apr  4 22:05:41 2023
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     false
 containerd:
  Version:          1.6.20
  GitCommit:        2806fc1057397dbaeefbea0e4e17bddfbd388f38
 runc:
  Version:          1.1.5
  GitCommit:        v1.1.5-0-gf19387a
 docker-init:
  Version:          0.19.0
  GitCommit:        de40ad0

C:\Users\mlh>
  ```
* or simply:
```bash
C:\Users\mlh>docker --version
Docker version 27.3.1,, build cb74dfc

C:\Users\mlh>
```

**Step 2: Test Docker Installation**
* Run Docker’s "Hello World" container to confirm the setup:
```bash
C:\Users\mlh>docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

With Docker successfully installed and verified, you're now ready to begin your journey into containerization. Let’s explore Docker’s core commands and functionalities in the next section
