# File Download Instructions

The dataset is too large to be downloaded programmatically via the Kaggle API due to system limitations or restrictions on large file transfers. As a result, you need to manually download the file directly from Kaggle by following these steps:

1. Visit the Kaggle competition or dataset page: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration).
2. Log in to your Kaggle account.
3. Navigate to the Data tab or section of the page.
4. Select and download the dataset manually to your local machine. Ensure you choose the complete dataset if multiple options are provided.
5. Place the downloaded file in the specified directory of the project (e.g., data/).


Once the file is in the appropriate directory, you can proceed with running the subsequent steps in the pipeline or analysis script.
